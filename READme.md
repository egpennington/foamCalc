# Fire Foam Calculator App

## Overview
The **Fire Foam Calculator App** is a tool designed to calculate fire foam requirements for various tank sizes. Users can input a tank number to retrieve pre-configured data and see calculations such as square footage, critical application rate, foam requirements (1% and 3%), and real-time wind data.

### Features
- **Tank Data Lookup:** Enter a tank number to fetch details like diameter, capacity, material, and location.
- **Foam Calculations:** Computes gallons per minute (GPM) and total foam required for 65 minutes.
- **Real-Time Wind Data:** Displays current wind speed and direction for the selected tank location.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layout, optimized for both small and large screens.
- **Hamburger Menu:** Includes an "About" section with details on calculations and tank references.
- **Sliding Menu:** The "About" menu slides in smoothly from the left.
- **Route Images:** Clickable location links provide tank-specific route images for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For the structure of the app.
- **CSS:** For responsive and styled layouts.
- **JavaScript:** For calculations, wind data integration, and interactivity.
- **OpenWeather API:** Fetches real-time wind speed and direction.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Tank:** Use the dropdown to select a valid tank.
2. **View Results:** The app automatically calculates foam requirements and displays wind data.
3. **Recalculate:** Use the "Recalculate" button to refresh calculations if needed.
4. **View Tank Route:** Click on the tank location link to view a route image for that tank.
5. **About Menu:** Use the hamburger menu to open the "About" section and see detailed information on how the app works.
